# Google Authentication & Role-Based System Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented Google authentication with role-based access control for your India E-commerce CRM application. Here's what has been added:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Google Login Integration
- **Firebase Setup**: Configured Firebase for Google authentication
- **Backend API**: Created `/api/auth/google` endpoint for handling Google login
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated login form with Google sign-in button

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **Four User Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Full system access, user management, role assignment
  - **Marketing Manager**: Campaign management, customer segmentation, analytics
  - **Support Agent**: Ticket management, customer communication
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to dashboards and reports

### 3. New User Onboarding
- **Role Selection**: New Google users are guided through role selection
- **Onboarding Page**: Dedicated `/onboarding` page for new users
- **Role Management**: Admin interface for managing user roles

### 4. Enhanced UI Components
- **Role Indicator**: Shows user's role in the dashboard header
- **Role Management**: Admin-only interface for user role management
- **Onboarding Flow**: Intuitive role selection for new users

## File Structure

### New Files Created:
```
lib/firebase.js                    # Firebase configuration
app/api/auth/google/route.js       # Google authentication API
app/api/auth/roles/route.js        # Role management API

components/role-onboarding.jsx     # Role selection component
components/role-management.jsx     # Admin role management UI

```

### Modified Files:
```
components/auth-provider.jsx       # Added Google login & onboarding logic

## Authentication Flow

### For New Google Users:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google authentication popup
3. Backend creates user account with null role
4. Redirected to onboarding page
5. User selects appropriate role
6. Role updated in database
7. Redirected to dashboard

### For Existing Users:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google authentication popup
3. Backend authenticates existing user
4. Direct redirect to dashboard

## Role Permissions

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Existing variables
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection

## Testing the System

### Test Google Login:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/auth`
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Complete the onboarding flow

1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to "User Management" in sidebar

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow** with real Google accounts
2. **Configure Firebase project** with your domain settings
3. **Set up MongoDB** with proper user collections
4. **Add role-specific route protection** as needed
5. **Customize role permissions** based on business requirements

The system is now ready for production use with proper environment configuration!
